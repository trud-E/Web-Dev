        <p>If this headline interests you, then you need to visit Norway. Surely, you yourself have heard a lot about <strong class="color-red">Norway</strong> - about the country of fjords and Vikings, where from a mixture of water in all its physical states, rocks, greenery and a very special atmosphere, an amazing world emerges that attracts you with its unusualness.<strong class="color-red"><em>Fjords and ferries</em></strong> are a big part of the most popular excursions. People come here to look at the rocks from the water, sail through all the fjords, visit the <em><strong class="color-red">Lofoten Islands</strong></em>, learn more about the harsh life of the Vikings and go fishing.</p>
        
        <p>We look at Norway from a different perspective. Active holidays with us include trekking, excursions to off-the-beaten-path places and new places that are unlike anything else. Preacher's Rock, Pea, Troll's Tongue, Folgefonna glacier, Mount Galhepiggen, Bessegen trail - we see all this with our own eyes and get to know the very soul of Norway!</p>
